# Andrew NG's Coursera Deep Learning course notes

Course notes for Andrew NG's [Deep Learning course on Coursera](https://www.deeplearning.ai).
All screenshot come from the course's videos, full credit to Professor Ng for the great lecture course.

So far just the notes from the first course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning are present. I'll complete the other courses soon, stay posted.

If you prefer reading a pdf, there are several tool online to convert it, otherwise drop me an email at [gianluca@ai-academy.com](mailto:gianluca@ai-academy.com) and I'll send you a pdf made with LaTeX.

Solution to exercises are not present here, I'm not sure wether that would be OK with Coursera's rules. If you need them and you know that it's OK to publish them, let me know and I'll add them to the repo.

Full Program:
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](NNs_deeplearning.md)
2. Improving Deep NNs: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularisation and Optimisation
3. Structuring your ML project
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
5. Natural Language Processing: Building sequence models
